# go-nagios
Go client for managing Nagios XI

This is a future project coming up to split the go client out of the [terraform-provider-nagios](https://github.com/devopsdunkin/terraform-provider-nagios) repo and make it a consumable go package that can be used to interact and manage Nagios XI without the use of Terraform. Repo is currently just a placeholder for this and will hopefully be coming in the coming months
